# Provisioners

Provisioners are used to execute scripts on a local or remote machine
as part of resource creation or destruction. Provisioners can be used to
bootstrap a resource, cleanup before destroy, run configuration management, etc.

## Available Provisioners

Terraform includes several built-in provisioners. Use the navigation sidebar to
view their documentation.

You can also install third-party provisioners as plugins by placing them in the
user plugins directory. The user plugins directory is in one of the following
locations, depending on the host operating system:

Operating system  | User plugins directory
------------------|-----------------------
Windows           | `%APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins`
All other systems | `~/.terraform.d/plugins`

## Configuration Syntax

You can add a provisioner to any resource by using a nested `provisioner` block.

Most provisioners also require connection settings (in a nested `connection`
block) in order to access the remote resource. For full details, see
[Provisioner Connection Settings](./connection.html).

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${self.private_ip} > file.txt"
  }
}
```

The label of a `provisioner` block is the name of the desired provisioner, and
the arguments in the block body configure the provisioner's behavior.

Each provisioner defines its own configuration arguments. There are also two
meta-arguments supported by all provisioners (`when` and `on_failure`), which
are described below (see [Destroy-Time Provisioners](#destroy-time-provisioners)
and [Failure Behavior](#failure-behavior)).

### The `self` Object

Within `provisioner` blocks, an additional `self` object is available in
expressions.

The `self` object represents the provisioner's parent resource, and any of that
resource's attributes can be accessed as attributes of `self`. For example, an
`aws_instance` resource's `public_ip` attribute can be referenced as
`self.public_ip` within its provisioner configuration.

-> **Note:** The `self` object exists because the `count` and `each` objects
aren't available within nested `provisioner` or `connection` blocks, and
provisioners commonly need to refer to attributes of the specific resource
instance they configure.

## Creation-Time Provisioners

By default, provisioners run when the resource they are defined within is
created. Creation-time provisioners are only run during _creation_, not
during updating or any other lifecycle. They are meant as a means to perform
bootstrapping of a system.

If a creation-time provisioner fails, the resource is marked as **tainted**.
A tainted resource will be planned for destruction and recreation upon the
next `terraform apply`. Terraform does this because a failed provisioner
can leave a resource in a semi-configured state. Because Terraform cannot
reason about what the provisioner does, the only way to ensure proper creation
of a resource is to recreate it. This is tainting.

You can change this behavior by setting the `on_failure` attribute,
which is covered in detail below.

## Destroy-Time Provisioners

If `when = "destroy"` is specified, the provisioner will run when the
resource it is defined within is _destroyed_.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    when    = "destroy"
    command = "echo 'Destroy-time provisioner'"
  }
}
```

Destroy provisioners are run before the resource is destroyed. If they
fail, Terraform will error and rerun the provisioners again on the next
`terraform apply`. Due to this behavior, care should be taken for destroy
provisioners to be safe to run multiple times.

Destroy-time provisioners can only run if they remain in the configuration
at the time a resource is destroyed. If a resource block with a destroy-time
provisioner is removed entirely from the configuration, its provisioner
configurations are removed along with it and thus the destroy provisioner
won't run. To work around this, a multi-step process can be used to safely
remove a resource with a destroy-time provisioner:

* Update the resource configuration to include `count = 0`.
* Apply the configuration to destroy any existing instances of the resource, including running the destroy provisioner.
* Remove the resource block entirely from configuration, along with its `provisioner` blocks.
* Apply again, at which point no further action should be taken since the resources were already destroyed.

This limitation may be addressed in future versions of Terraform. For now,
destroy-time provisioners must be used sparingly and with care.

~> **NOTE:** A destroy-time provisioner within a resource that is tainted _will not_ run. This includes resources that are marked tainted from a failed creation-time provisioner or tainted manually using `terraform taint`.

## Multiple Provisioners

Multiple provisioners can be specified within a resource. Multiple provisioners
are executed in the order they're defined in the configuration file.

You may also mix and match creation and destruction provisioners. Only
the provisioners that are valid for a given operation will be run. Those
valid provisioners will be run in the order they're defined in the configuration
file.

Example of multiple provisioners:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo first"
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo second"
  }
}
```

## Failure Behavior

By default, provisioners that fail will also cause the Terraform apply
itself to fail. The `on_failure` setting can be used to change this. The
allowed values are:

- `"continue"` - Ignore the error and continue with creation or destruction.

- `"fail"` - Raise an error and stop applying (the default behavior). If this is a creation provisioner,
    taint the resource.

Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command    = "echo ${self.private_ip} > file.txt"
    on_failure = "continue"
  }
}
```
